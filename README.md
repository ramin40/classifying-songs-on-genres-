# classifying-songs-on-genres-
- classifying songs on genres using sickit-learn (decision tree)
- my goal is to look through this dataset and classify songs as being either 'Hip-Hop' or 'Rock' - all without listening to a single song. 
- In doing so must:
1)  clean data
2) do some exploratory data visualization
3) use feature reduction towards feeding data through some simple machine learning algorithms
